These scipts will be used to model and fit SED profiles to YSOs in the Cha I star forming region, using a radiative transfer equation for a Disk Models and stellar atmosphere Phoenix or Kurucz Models. Using these models alongside MCMC method implimented by using Emcee to explore the parameter space of the disk models.

*This respository currently in the works of collecting all codes to be uploaded.
